# Unity_Nonogram
A little project Nonogram problems, it was created to Algorthms Analisys course to ITCR.
I used Unity 2019.2.20F1 to create this.
It needs read a TXT document in a specifict format to create the arrays to proced with the Nonogram solution.
The TXT format is:
2, 3
FILAS
2
1, 1
COLUMNAS
2
1
1

where the first line says the dimentions, the second the rows and continues with the diferents rows until arrive to separation line 
to columns, in this example are the lines 1, 2, 5. This example are in Spanish cause it is the format stablished by the Professor.
